To deploy the website, you must install packages in the backend, this is done by doing:
"cd course-project/backend" followed by:
"npm install express prisma @prisma/client sqlite3 bcrypt jsonwebtoken cors multer zod uuid"
"npm install --save-dev nodemon"
"npx prisma migrate deploy"
"npm run seed"
For the frontend, execute the following:
"cd course-project/frontend" followed by:
"npm install express prisma @prisma/client sqlite3 bcrypt jsonwebtoken cors multer zod uuid" and
"npm install --save-dev nodemon"

Running "npm run dev" on both frontend and backend directories allows you to run the application locally.

We deployed using Railway, to deploy this yourself using Railway, follow these steps:
1. Create a Railway project and link your backend folder.
2. Set variables in the raw env editor on Railway:
    JWT_SECRET=SECRET-TOKEN-HERE
3. Create another service for the frontend.
4. Set environment variables for API URL:
    VITE_API_URL=https://BACKEND_URL.up.railway.app
5. Set the build command as: "npm run build"
6. If SQLite is being used for the database, we used this template on Railway to integrate the database:
    https://railway.com/deploy/jOiNFt
    Deploy this in the same service as the backend, and add this to the variables found in step 2:
    DATABASE_URL=DATABASE-URL-HERE.up.railway.app
7. Deploy the frontend, backend, and database
