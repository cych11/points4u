Michal Buczek:
  My AI use is as follows:
  - used Chat GPT and Google Gemini for small syntax related queries
  - Used Github Co-Pilot for some autocomplete on small code segments
  - Generated fronted UI code with Github Co-Pilot for listing event guests and organizers, 
    I read through the code and understood it and manual modifications and additions, such as points awarding.
  - I also generated the burger navigation menus with Github Co-Pilot to speed up development. 
    Again, I made sure I understand the code.
  - Used Chat GPT for debugging console error messages and implementation, but made sure to manually do corrections and solved most of them myself.
  - I am not aware of the extent to which AI was used by team members so will not comment on their usage.
